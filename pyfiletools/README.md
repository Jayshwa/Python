# pyfiletools

Welcome to my "pyfiletools" project repository!

## About the Project

"pyfiletools" is a collection of Python scripts and tools that I've developed to enhance my understanding of the `os`, `shutil`, and `getpass` modules in Python. These modules are fundamental for working with files, directories, and system-related tasks.

This project is a reflection of my ongoing journey to deepen my knowledge of Python and its applications in system administration and automation.

## Features

- **os Module**: Explore scripts that leverage the `os` module for file and directory operations, including listing files, creating directories, and more.

- **shutil Module**: Discover how the `shutil` module can be used to perform file operations such as copying, moving, and removing files and directories.

- **getpass Module**: Learn about secure password input with the `getpass` module, which is particularly useful for sensitive interactions.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the scripts and tools within this repository. Each script is documented with comments to help you understand its purpose and usage.
